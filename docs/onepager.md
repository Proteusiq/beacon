### Business Need:

Becon Friers seeks to enhance user engagement by developing a sophisticated book recommendation tool. The tool should effectively analyze users' descriptions, ensuring that relevant book suggestions are made based on their interests and preferences. By accurately matching descriptions to popular book titles, Becon Friers can improve user satisfaction, drive traffic, and foster a community around reading.

### User Stories & Acceptance Criteria:

1. **User Story 1:** As a user describing a "vampire love drama," I want to receive targeted recommendations so that I can discover relevant titles.

   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool should return "The Twilight Saga" when users input "vampire love drama" with a minimum accuracy of 80% on the top 5 recommendations.

2. **User Story 2:** As a user searching for a "lawyer driving in a fancy car," I want recommendations that fit this criteria to find books that I want to read.

   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool should return "The Lincoln Lawyer" as one of the top recommendations when the user provides this description, with a match accuracy of 4 out of 5 most relevant suggestions.

3. **User Story 3:** As a user interested in "a boy going to a magic school of wizards," I want the tool to connect me with the most fitting book options.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool should list "Harry Potter" among the top 5 results, with a 90% accuracy on matches based on the userâ€™s description.

### Sample Data Overview:

The tool will utilize data from `data/goodreads_top100_from1980to2023.csv`, containing titles and descriptions of English-language books.

- **Quality:** The dataset has been curated to include popular titles from the Goodreads community, ensuring a base level of relevance.

- **Limitations:** Some descriptions in the dataset may primarily consist of user reviews rather than objective descriptions of the books. Additionally, certain entries may contain incomplete or vague descriptors, potentially impacting recommendation accuracy.

- **Potential Biases:** User reviews may reflect personal opinions that do not universally apply, which could skew the recommendation process if not parsed appropriately.

---

### Constraints & Assumptions:

- **Technical Constraints:** The tool's performance is bound by the processing power available and the data retrieval capabilities from the CSV file.
- **Time Constraints:** Development must be completed within the next quarter to align with user engagement goals.
- **Regulatory Considerations:** Ensure compliance with copyright laws when utilizing descriptions and titles from the dataset.
